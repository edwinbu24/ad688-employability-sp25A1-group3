## Introduction

This project explores **Salary & Compensation Trends** in 2024, focusing on how wages vary across different careers, industries, and job types. As advancements in **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** continue to reshape the job market, understanding salary trends has become crucial for both professionals and organizations. My research aims to uncover key insights into how AI-related jobs compare to traditional careers in terms of compensation, regional salary differences, and the impact of remote work on wages.

By exploring these questions, this research will provide actionable insights for individuals can position themselves effectively given changes in hiring trends, salaries, AI adoption, remote work, and gender-based employment patterns in the age of AI.
