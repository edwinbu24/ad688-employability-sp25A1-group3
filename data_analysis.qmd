# Job Postings by Industry 
## Observations
- The bar chart shows the distribution of job postings across various industries.
- Industries like "Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services", "Manufacturing", and "Health Care and Social Assistance" have the highest number of job postings.
- Other industries, such as "Retail Trade", "Educational Services", and "Finance and Insurance", also show significant job postings but are less prominent compared to the top industries.
- The "Unclassified Industry" category has a noticeable number of job postings, which may represent miscellaneous or undefined sectors.

## Key Insights
- High-Demand Industries: Industries like professional services, manufacturing, and healthcare are actively hiring, indicating strong demand in these sectors.
- Diverse Opportunities: The presence of job postings across a wide range of industries (e.g., retail, education, finance) suggests a diverse job market.
- Unclassified Industry: The significant number of job postings in the "Unclassified Industry" category may require further investigation to understand the nature of these roles.

## Recommendations
- Focus on High-Demand Sectors: Job seekers should prioritize industries with the highest number of job postings, such as professional services, manufacturing, and healthcare.
- Explore Unclassified Roles: Investigate the "Unclassified Industry" category to identify potential opportunities that may not fit into traditional industry classifications.

```{python}
fig = px.box(df, x="NAICS_2022_2_NAME", y="SALARY", title="Salary Distribution by Industry")

```
<iframe src="./figures/salary_distribution_by_industry.html" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

# Salary Distribution by Industry
## Observations
- The box plot shows the salary distribution across industries.
- Industries like "Utilities", "Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction", and "Finance and Insurance" likely have higher median salaries.
- Industries such as "Accommodation and Food Services", "Retail Trade", and "Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation" tend to have lower median salaries.

## Key Insights
- High-Paying Industries: Industries like utilities, mining, and finance offer higher salaries, likely due to the specialized skills and expertise required.
- Low-Paying Industries: Sectors like accommodation and food services, retail trade, and arts and entertainment have lower salaries, which may reflect the nature of the work and the skill levels required.
- Salary Disparities: There is a noticeable disparity in salaries across industries, with some offering significantly higher compensation than others.

## Recommendations
- Target High-Paying Sectors: Job seekers looking for higher salaries should focus on industries like utilities, mining, and finance.
- Explore Salary Trends: Further analyze salary trends within specific industries to identify roles with the highest earning potential.

# Remote vs. on-site jobs
remote_counts = df["REMOTE_TYPE_NAME"].value_counts().reset_index()
remote_counts.columns = ["Remote Type", "Count"]

# Save the figure as HTML (Plotly)
fig = px.pie(remote_counts, names="Remote Type", values="Count", title="Remote vs. On-Site Jobs")
fig.write_html("./figures/remote_vs_onsite_jobs.html")

# Display the figure
fig.show()
```
<iframe src="./figures/remote_vs_onsite_jobs.html" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

# Remote vs. On-Site Jobs
## Observations
- The pie chart shows the distribution of job types:
  - Not Remote: 78.3%
  - Remote: 3.11%
  - Hybrid Remote: 1.58%
  - None: 17%
- The vast majority of jobs are not remote, indicating a strong preference for on-site work.
- Remote and hybrid remote jobs make up a small fraction of the total job postings.

## Key Insights
- On-Site Dominance: The job market is still heavily skewed toward on-site work, with only a small percentage of roles offering remote or hybrid options.
- Limited Remote Opportunities: Remote and hybrid roles are still niche, suggesting that companies may not yet fully embrace flexible work arrangements.
- Ambiguity in "None" Category: The 17% labeled as "None" is unclear and may represent roles where the work arrangement is unspecified.

## Recommendations
- Express Willingness to Work On-Site: Job-seekers looking to join companies may consider expressing willingness to work on site , as these are still largely represented in the job market.
