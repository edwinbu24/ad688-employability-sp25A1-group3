# Job Postings by Industry 
## Observations
- The bar chart shows the distribution of job postings across various industries.
- Industries like "Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services", "Manufacturing", and "Health Care and Social Assistance" have the highest number of job postings.
- Other industries, such as "Retail Trade", "Educational Services", and "Finance and Insurance", also show significant job postings but are less prominent compared to the top industries.
- The "Unclassified Industry" category has a noticeable number of job postings, which may represent miscellaneous or undefined sectors.

## Key Insights
- High-Demand Industries: Industries like professional services, manufacturing, and healthcare are actively hiring, indicating strong demand in these sectors.
- Diverse Opportunities: The presence of job postings across a wide range of industries (e.g., retail, education, finance) suggests a diverse job market.
- Unclassified Industry: The significant number of job postings in the "Unclassified Industry" category may require further investigation to understand the nature of these roles.

## Recommendations
- Focus on High-Demand Sectors: Job seekers should prioritize industries with the highest number of job postings, such as professional services, manufacturing, and healthcare.
- Explore Unclassified Roles: Investigate the "Unclassified Industry" category to identify potential opportunities that may not fit into traditional industry classifications.

```{python}
# Additional data cleaning and feature engineering
df['POSTED_DATE'] = pd.to_datetime(df['POSTED'])
df['POSTED_YEAR'] = df['POSTED_DATE'].dt.year
df['POSTED_MONTH'] = df['POSTED_DATE'].dt.month

# Create a simplified location feature by extracting state from LOCATION
df['STATE'] = df['LOCATION'].str.extract(r', (\w{2})$')

# Corrected Monthly Trend Analysis
monthly_trend = df.groupby(['POSTED_YEAR', 'POSTED_MONTH']).size().reset_index(name='Count')

# Create a proper datetime column by combining year and month with day=1
monthly_trend['Date'] = pd.to_datetime(
    monthly_trend['POSTED_YEAR'].astype(str) + '-' + 
    monthly_trend['POSTED_MONTH'].astype(str) + '-01'
)
```
```{python}
# Create the visualization
fig = px.line(monthly_trend, x='Date', y='Count', 
              title='Monthly Trend of Job Postings',
              labels={'Count': 'Number of Job Postings'},
              template='plotly_white')
fig.update_xaxes(title_text='Month', tickformat='%b %Y')
fig.update_layout(hovermode='x unified')
fig.write_html("./figures/monthly_job_postings_trend.html")
fig.show()
```
<iframe src="./figures/monthly_job_postings_trend.html" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

## Observation: Seasonal Hiring Patterns
- The monthly trend reveals a steady increase in job postings from May to August 2024, with a notable spike in August 2024 (approximately 14.5K postings). This aligns with typical mid-year hiring surges, possibly driven by:

  - Post-budget approval cycles (companies ramping up hiring after Q2 financial reviews).

  - Seasonal demand (e.g., healthcare roles before flu season, retail preparing for back-to-school).

- The dip in Jul 2024 (~13K postings) may reflect temporary slowdowns due to summer vacations or fiscal quarter transitions.

## Actionable Insight:
- Job seekers should target August for applications, while recruiters might anticipate higher competition during these peak months.

```{python}
fig = px.box(df, x="NAICS_2022_2_NAME", y="SALARY", title="Salary Distribution by Industry")

fig.write_html("./figures/salary_distribution_by_industry.html")  # Save the figure

fig.show()

```
<iframe src="./figures/salary_distribution_by_industry.html" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

# Salary Distribution by Industry
## Observations
- The box plot shows the salary distribution across industries.
- Industries like "Utilities", "Mining, Quarrying, and Oil and Gas Extraction", and "Finance and Insurance" likely have higher median salaries.
- Industries such as "Accommodation and Food Services", "Retail Trade", and "Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation" tend to have lower median salaries.

## Key Insights
- High-Paying Industries: Industries like utilities, mining, and finance offer higher salaries, likely due to the specialized skills and expertise required.
- Low-Paying Industries: Sectors like accommodation and food services, retail trade, and arts and entertainment have lower salaries, which may reflect the nature of the work and the skill levels required.
- Salary Disparities: There is a noticeable disparity in salaries across industries, with some offering significantly higher compensation than others.

## Recommendations
- Target High-Paying Sectors: Job seekers looking for higher salaries should focus on industries like utilities, mining, and finance.
- Explore Salary Trends: Further analyze salary trends within specific industries to identify roles with the highest earning potential.

```{python}
# Top 15 industries by job postings with salary information
top_industries = df['NAICS_2022_2_NAME'].value_counts().nlargest(15).index
industry_salary = df[df['NAICS_2022_2_NAME'].isin(top_industries)]

fig = px.box(industry_salary, x='NAICS_2022_2_NAME', y='SALARY', 
             color='NAICS_2022_2_NAME',
             title='Salary Distribution Across Top 15 Industries',
             labels={'NAICS_2022_2_NAME': 'Industry', 'SALARY': 'Salary'},
             template='plotly_white')
fig.update_layout(showlegend=False, xaxis_tickangle=-45)
fig.write_html("./figures/top_industries_salary_distribution.html")
fig.show()
```
<iframe src="./figures/top_industries_salary_distribution.html" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

## Observation: Salary Peaks in High-Demand Service Sectors
- Administrative/Support/Waste Management emerges as the highest-paying sector among top industries, likely due to:

  - Specialized roles in remediation services (hazardous waste, environmental compliance).

  - High demand for business support functions (IT, HR, logistics) in competitive markets.

- Information and Healthcare/Social Assistance follow closely, reflecting:

  - Tech-driven salaries (software, data security) in Information.

  - Critical labor shortages elevating wages in Healthcare.

- Public Administration and Utilities show moderate but stable salaries, possibly tied to government pay scales or unionized roles.

- Educational Services and Real Estate appear lower-mid range, suggesting variability (e.g., tenured vs. adjunct positions, commercial vs. residential real estate).

### Notable Gap:
- While Technical Services and Manufacturing have high job volumes, their salaries are not top-tier, indicating possible oversupply of candidates or automation pressures.

## Recommendation:
- Job seekers should weigh salary against growth potentialâ€”e.g., Information may offer higher long-term earnings than Administrative/Support despite similar current pay.

```{python}
# Remote vs. on-site jobs
remote_counts = df["REMOTE_TYPE_NAME"].value_counts().reset_index()
remote_counts.columns = ["Remote Type", "Count"]

# Save the figure as HTML (Plotly)
fig = px.pie(remote_counts, names="Remote Type", values="Count", title="Remote vs. On-Site Jobs")
fig.write_html("./figures/remote_vs_onsite_jobs.html")

# Display the figure
fig.show()
```
<iframe src="./figures/remote_vs_onsite_jobs.html" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

# Remote vs. On-Site Jobs
## Observations
- The pie chart shows the distribution of job types:
  - Not Remote: 78.3%
  - Remote: 3.11%
  - Hybrid Remote: 1.58%
  - None: 17%
- The vast majority of jobs are not remote, indicating a strong preference for on-site work.
- Remote and hybrid remote jobs make up a small fraction of the total job postings.

## Key Insights
- On-Site Dominance: The job market is still heavily skewed toward on-site work, with only a small percentage of roles offering remote or hybrid options.
- Limited Remote Opportunities: Remote and hybrid roles are still niche, suggesting that companies may not yet fully embrace flexible work arrangements.
- Ambiguity in "None" Category: The 17% labeled as "None" is unclear and may represent roles where the work arrangement is unspecified.

## Recommendations
- Express Willingness to Work On-Site: Job-seekers looking to join companies may consider expressing willingness to work on site , as these are still largely represented in the job market.

```{python}
# Remote work trends by industry
remote_industry = df.groupby(['NAICS_2022_2_NAME', 'REMOTE_TYPE_NAME']).size().unstack().fillna(0)
remote_industry['Total'] = remote_industry.sum(axis=1)
remote_industry = remote_industry.sort_values('Total', ascending=False).head(15)
remote_industry = remote_industry.drop('Total', axis=1)

fig = px.bar(remote_industry, 
             title='Remote Work Distribution Across Top Industries',
             labels={'value': 'Number of Postings', 'NAICS_2022_2_NAME': 'Industry'},
             barmode='stack')
fig.update_layout(xaxis_tickangle=-45)
fig.write_html("./figures/remote_work_by_industry.html")
fig.show()
```
<iframe src="./figures/remote_work_by_industry.html" width="100%" height="500px"></iframe>

## Observation: Industry-Specific Remote Work Adoption
- Finance/Insurance leads in absolute remote roles (1,721), reflecting:

  - Digital transformation in banking/fintech enabling remote work.

  - Client-facing roles (e.g., advisors) adapting to hybrid models (283 hybrid).

- Administrative/Support shows the highest hybrid adoption (350 hybrid), suggesting:

  - Field services (e.g., waste remediation) require partial on-site presence.

  - Back-office functions (e.g., HR, payroll) transitioning to hybrid.

- Manufacturing has limited remote options (733 remote) due to:

  - Production-line dependencies, though engineering/design roles may account for remote exceptions.

- Information has the highest remote:onsite ratio (751 remote vs. 38 on-site), confirming:

  - Tech roles (software, cybersecurity) as most adaptable to full-remote work.

### Hidden Insight:
- The "None" category (17% overall) likely includes:

  - Roles with undisclosed flexibility (e.g., "negotiable").

  - Legacy postings pre-dating remote-work standardization.

## Strategic Recommendation:
- Job seekers should:

  - Target Information/Finance for fully remote roles.

  - Consider hybrid in Administrative/Support for balance.

  - Verify "None" postings directly with employers for hidden flexibility.
